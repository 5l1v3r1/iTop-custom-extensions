# Warning
Currently updating/testing a new version of Mail to Ticket Automation. 
Rewrote a lot of things to match Combodo's new implementation of their own Mail to Ticket (3.0.11)
 
# Compatibility
I currently develop for iTop 2.4.1
Extensions most likely work with any 2.4.x-version. 

It's unknown if extensions work on older versions of iTop. See older branches to be sure, but you might miss out on fixes, changes, new features ...
 
# Folders
- **utilities**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web**: extensions which are actively maintained. You can drop and merge this under <iTop folder>/web


- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished.


See the Wiki on GitHub for more information on the extensions/modules.

iTop is an open source product by Combodo.
