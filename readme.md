# Warning
Currently updating/testing a new version of Mail to Ticket Automation. 
Rewrote a lot of things to match Combodo's new implementation of their own Mail to Ticket (3.0.11)
 
# Compatibility
I currently develop for iTop 2.4.1
Extensions most likely work with any 2.4.x-version. 

It's unknown if extensions work on older versions of iTop. See older branches to be sure, but you might miss out on fixes, changes, new features ...

# More info on the customizations
See the Wiki on GitHub for more information on the extensions/modules: https://github.com/jbostoen/iTop-custom-extensions/wiki
 
# Folders
- **utilities**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web**: extensions which are actively maintained. You can drop and merge this under <iTop folder>/web .


- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished.

# What is iTop?
iTop is an open source product by Combodo. "iTop stands for IT Operational Portal. iTop is an Open Source web application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. At the heart of iTop is the CMDB (Configuration Management Data Base), this is originally the first part of iTop that was developed."
