# What is iTop?
"iTop stands for IT Operational Portal. iTop is an Open Source web application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. At the heart of iTop is the CMDB (Configuration Management Data Base), this is originally the first part of iTop that was developed." 

It's developed by a great team at Combodo.

For any general support questions (issues/questions NOT caused by my extensions):
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) (as of end of August, 2018)
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/itop/discussion/)


# Branches
- master works with iTop 2.6.x and is used for active ongoing development
- itop-2.6 is more stable
- itop-2.5 is only offered for people who haven't migrated yet. Older versions are no longer available.


# Compatibility
I am developing ***unofficial*** extensions (simple tweaks, extra features) for iTop using PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7.

It's unknown if these extensions work on older versions of iTop. For most of them, only minor adjustments might be enough (downgrading data model version number, dependencies).

# History
I (jbostoen) started using iTop in 2015. Since then, I've been using and customizing this application more every day. I also stimulated others to use it and also made small contributions to iTop, both in code and translations.

In the meanwhile, my colleague [jdefoort](https://github.com/jdefoort) also became an iTop enthousiast and we often collaborate on new extensions.
