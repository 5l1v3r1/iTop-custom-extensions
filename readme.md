# Compatibility
I (jbostoen) currently maintain a few **unofficial** extensions (tweaks, extra features) for iTop 2.4.1
Extensions most likely work with any 2.4.x-version. 
It's unknown if extensions work on older versions of iTop. 

There's a branch available which was compatible with 2.3.x-versions, but it's no longer maintained.
You will miss out on fixes, changes, new features ...
 
 
# Folders
- **docs**: contains info/hints on using the extensions in this repository, but also on implementing/using iTop
- **utilities**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web/extensions**: extensions which are actively maintained. You can drop and merge this under <iTop folder>/web .

- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished.


# What is iTop?
iTop is an open source product by Combodo. "iTop stands for IT Operational Portal. iTop is an Open Source web application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. At the heart of iTop is the CMDB (Configuration Management Data Base), this is originally the first part of iTop that was developed."
