Warning: currently updating/testing a new version of Mail to Ticket Automation. 
Rewrote a lot of things to match Combodo's new implementation of their own Mail to Ticket (3.0.11)
 

**Compatible with iTop 2.4.1.**


To avoid confusion: 

- **utilities**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web**: extensions which are actively maintained


- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished.


See the Wiki on GitHub for more information on the extensions/modules.

iTop is an open source product by Combodo.
