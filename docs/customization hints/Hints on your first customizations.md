# Hints on your first customizations

Before you know it, someone might tell you that the answer to your question is to "create your own extension".

It does sound scary, right?

There's some really good documentation by Combodo. 
And some official examples; but there's a lot more in this repository too on how to accomplish certain things.

Most useful resources are:

* https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=latest%3Acustomization%3Adatamodel#content_of_a_module

Go ahead, experiment and conquer the world! :)
