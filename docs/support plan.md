# Goal
The goal is to support all extensions as long as they make sense. 
If iTop adds or removes a certain feature or changes datamodels, some extensions may become obsolete.

# Compatibility 
* development focus on the iTop Community Edition. ITIL-version of modules. No additional extensions.
* these customizations **might** not be compatible with other extensions (including official ones). If there are known incompatibility issues with **official** extensions, it will be clearly mentioned.



# Updates

## Branches
The current plan is to create a new branch for each iTop version which is not just a maintenance release.

This GitHub was created to host extensions (tweaks, extra features) which were originally developed for iTop 2.3.x-releases. 

With the official release of iTop 2.6.x, expect the following branches:
- **master** will be used for development. It may contain changes based on a beta version of iTop, before the new iTop version is officially released. Or for various commits.
- **itop-2.6** will be used for frequent releases of this repository. It will fully compatible with the latest stable iTop version.
- **itop-2.5** contains the last version of this repository (iTop 2.5.x). Older branches are deleted since it's never encouraged to stay on older versions (less features, increased risk of known vulnerabilities) 


Future:
- planned versions for iTop seem to be 2.7.x up to 2.8.x. Major changes are not expected when it comes to compatibility.

*IF* I move to iTop 2.6.x, the same scenario as above will be used. 
Also, the legacy branch for 2.4.x will then be completely removed.


# User support
These extensions are developed for internal use at the organization I work for.
I'll be testing them, but support is not guaranteed.

Most extensions were originally created to alter workflows to make them easier for us.
New classes and features may be added - but evaluated regularly. Use these type of extensions at your own risk.
