# Setting up a help desk

## Steps

* you need a delivery model for the organization (provider = yourself)
* you need to configure a service (and service subcategories)
* make your user (example: admin) part of a team (example: IT Crowd)
* link the delivery model to a customer contract and a team 
 
 

## Points to consider

### Teams / shared mailboxes
* a user request is coming from a user. However, when using shared mailboxes in your organization, you often see mails coming from the shared mail address. So it's recommended to create a **user** contact instead with last name = '-', first name: '<team>'. Be careful: if you actually have a **team** contact as well with this email address, processing will fail.
* just change the caller after the ticket's processed automatically

### Who's the actual caller?
* Cut the middle persons. A boss or key user shouldn't be creating contacts for others. Direct contact makes things much more efficient.

### No (B)CC!
* make it a policy not to accept these mails. Reason: if someone sends the initial mail with others in copy and they all start to reply, you'll have several new tickets. Also, it doesn't make sense to communicate with multiple people about a ticket.

### Notifications
* if you create a ticket, skip the public log, the Email Reply extension won't work right away.
