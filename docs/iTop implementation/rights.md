Unfortunately, iTop is not flexible when it comes to rights management.

A user will be linked to a profile (role). This role is the same for any organization the user is allowed to. If no specific organization(s) are provided, this user can see everything.

As for departments: iTop recommends to create them as suborganizations, but there's also a few limitations.
