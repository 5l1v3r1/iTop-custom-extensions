# iTop REST implementation

## What?
A simple PHP class which offers easy access to the most important iTop REST/JSON API actions.

Not everything is implemented, mostly:
* core/get
* core/update
* core/delete

There's a generic method to post and process other info; and prepare files to be sent to iTop.
