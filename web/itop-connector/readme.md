# What?
iTop Connector is a very basic PHP class which makes it easier to interact with iTop REST/JSON services. 
It can be used as a standalone class or it can be used as a base class to extend for specific purposes.

Since iTop 2.5.0, the user needs a specific profile to be able to perform REST-operations.

It's used for some of the work in this repository.
