## What?

Modifies Incident:
- prevents automatic computation of impacted items (computed). Often undesired: if you manually add a core switch, this could add a lot of 'computed' items which are also impacted - which makes it less obvious to see the ones that really matter (manually added). The tab 'impact analysis' still works the same.
