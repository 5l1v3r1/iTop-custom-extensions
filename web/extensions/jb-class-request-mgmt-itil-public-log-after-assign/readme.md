At our organization, we use the 'Email Reply' extension, which allows you to send the contents of public log entries you write to the caller of a UserRequest. 

However, if you create a new ticket, I often find myself writing something to the user right away in the public log. That mail never arrives. So this extension prevents me from writing anything in the public log before the ticket is created.
