# jb-class-monitor

Basically created to fix an issue in Combodo's example on how to create a class of your own. 
They provided an example on how to create a Monitor, but it was missing some information related to Model-typology. 
In April 2018, they accepted my fix.

This class still exists in my own repository because I still add a few new fields: number of VGA, HDMI and Display Ports.
