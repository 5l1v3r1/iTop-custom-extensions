# jb-class-monitor
Basically created to fix an issue in Combodo's example on how to create a class of your own. They provided an example on how to create a Monitor, but it was missing some information related to Model-typology. 

Soon the original purpose will be obsolete (Combodo accepted my fix), but in this class I still add a few new fields: number of VGA, HDMI and Display Ports.
