# jb-class-incident-mgmt-itil-no-computed-impact
When creating an incident, you might add for instance a firewall or core switch to the CI tab. If you allow iTop to compute all impacted objects, you might end up with a list of hundreds of items. This may make things overly complicated.

So, this extension disables 'compacted impact'. You can still run the 'impacts...' option from the menu to see this.
