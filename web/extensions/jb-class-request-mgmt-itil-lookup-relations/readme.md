# jb-class-request-mgmt-itil-lookup-relations

Always lookup relations to link to a User Request. By default, iTop only shows a short list with a reference only to a parent Problem, Incident, Change if you don't have many of them yet.

Note: you could force this for every field using an iTop configuration parameter. 
However, it may not be desired in most other cases.

Hint: if you have no items in any of the classes you want to link, you still won't see the search icon until you have at least 1 Problem, Incident, Change, UserRequest.
