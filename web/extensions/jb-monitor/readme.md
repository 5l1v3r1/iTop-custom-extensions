# jb-monitor

## What?

Originally created to fix an issue in Combodo's example on how to create a class of your own (Monitor). 
It was missing some information related to Model-typology. In April 2018, they accepted my fix.

This class still exists in my own repository because it's been extended with a few new fields: type (digital signage, beamer, monitor) or number of VGA, HDMI and Display Ports.

Be advised: this class may be renamed to Display in the future.
