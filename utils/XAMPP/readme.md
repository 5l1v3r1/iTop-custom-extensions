# BAT Run iTop Cron 

## What?

A bat script to run iTop's cron job.
Repeated every time the user hits [Enter]


# PS1 Keep iTop config writable

## What?

A PowerShell script you can run in the background.

If you're developing new extensions, you'll regularly need to run the setup wizard again. 
This means you have to make iTop's config file writable again. 
If you run this PowerShell and leave it open, it will make the config file writable on a regular short interval.
