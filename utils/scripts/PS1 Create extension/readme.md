# PS1 Create extension

## What?
This PowerShell script gives you a head start. 
It will guide you through a couple of questions and it will generate the necessary files to get started with a basic extension. 

The PowerShell script should be in the same folder as the folder 'template', which basically contains all the files for a basic extension.
