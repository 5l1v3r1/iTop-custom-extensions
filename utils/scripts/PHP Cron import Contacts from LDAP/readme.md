This is a sample script which takes info from an LDAP. 

So you can easily see how to import users in your Active Directory as iTop contacts. 
It relies on retrieving info from AD, writing it to a MySQL table (created within iTop), then use iTop's Data Synchronization.

As of end September 2018, Combodo also released "Data Collector for LDAP" as an extension. It offers some additional features compared to the script provided here; but my original script makes it possible to import info from multiple active directories and shows how to map organizations based on different criteria.
