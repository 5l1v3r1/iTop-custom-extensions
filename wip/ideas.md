General to do and idea list


jb-crab
- merge sync into a task here

jb-geom
- dashlet: filter
- dashlet: label feature
- dashlet: create new item
- dashlet: hover info

general ideas
- extend REST API so there's a way to get attachments as well with one request (improved 'get', for UserRequest)
- jb-dashlet-twig: something similar to jb-reportgen; add dashlet which renders Twig template of given DBObjectSet. kanban charts? ;)

won't do
- recurring events: Combodo is working on this
