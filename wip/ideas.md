General to do and idea list

# Improvements (existing extensions)

## jb-crab
- merge sync into a task here

## jb-geom
- dashlet: filter
- dashlet: label feature
- dashlet: create new item
- dashlet: hover info

# New extensions

## jb-merge-tickets
- generic merging of tickets. Select multiple tickets, select 'parent'/destination ticket. 
- todo: figure out workflow. 
- only specific attributes (public_log, private_log)
- related CIs, contacts should be merged too
- same for attachments
- what about (unwanted) update notifications?
- what about reordering caselogs, is this possible?

## jb-dashlet-twig
- something similar to jb-reportgen; add dashlet which renders Twig template of given DBObjectSet.
- could offer an alternative way to display data
- alternative kanban cards? (but Combodo was planning that so no point)

# Misc
- extend REST API so there's a way to get attachments as well with one request (improved 'get', for UserRequest)


# Currently out of scope
- recurring events: Combodo is working on this and has done some nice work, just be patient
