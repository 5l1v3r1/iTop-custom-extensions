# jb-object-merge

Can't be used for now. Very early development stage.
Developed in personal time.

If you are interested in a quick development of this extension or a specific feature, consider getting in touch and sponsor it.

## What?
Merges objects (primarily meant for any subclass of Ticket)

## Ideas
* generic approach, but primarily aimed at subclasses of Ticket.
* not seen before in this repo: customizing iTop UI (similar to TeemIP)
* one Ticket is chosen as "destination" ticket. User decides which ticket will be kept most intact, and where other info will come from.
* merging of case log entries (sort!) + possible append/prepend
* merging of related functional CIs, functional Contacts, ... Update IDs in 'lnkX' classes AND keep them unique (delete if not necessary)?
* perhaps merging of WorkOrders. Can something generic be derived from the datamodel? 
* auto-close or auto-delete original tickets
