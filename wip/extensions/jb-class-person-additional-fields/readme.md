# jb-class-person-additional-fields

## What?
Adds some fields to Person class.
Fields: gender, date of birth, client ID

The idea was to explore how fields can be hidden from some users (or masked).
This extension does not function properly!

## Cookbook

Learn how to:

XML
- add fields

PHP
- add fields which are NOT defined in the datamodel XML

- use GetAttributeFlags() for viewing/modifying details; uses GetAsHTML() - for lists, GetAsCSV() - for exports, GetAsXML() - for exports 
- set tracking level of changes for those fields to none
