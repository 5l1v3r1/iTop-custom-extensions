The idea is to create an extension to expand all CaseLog entries.
Either by default or maybe with a button.

Use case: when you document a change along the way, you have lots of CaseLog entries. But when you want to search (CTRL + F on the page) for something in the Change, you must first uncollapse evertyhing.

Currently according to Combodo, there's no such option by default.
