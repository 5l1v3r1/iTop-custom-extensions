# jb-action-rest

## What?
Adds a REST action, to which you can link a trigger (on object creation, on object update, on object delete, ...).

The data posted contains information about the object, the current user and the trigger.
Rather than implementing a very specific integration, the idea is to post all data to any endpoint (service, script).

## Special notes
* This can be used to interact with Microsoft Teams, with some further development!
* If you want to use this extension and get support or a very specific integration, get in touch please to discuss terms: jbostoen.itop@outlook.com
