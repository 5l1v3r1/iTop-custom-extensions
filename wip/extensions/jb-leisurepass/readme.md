On hold till iTop properly implements cascading. 

Actually created a fix for AttributeImage which could be extended to AttributeBlob etc.
Would work in iTop, additional fixes might be needed for export. Unfortunately, because the patch is only written for AttributeImage, it has not been accepted by Combodo to be implemented in iTop.
