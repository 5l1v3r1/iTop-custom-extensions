## What?
Improved software and software license management.

This aims to replace the Software Catalog and Software instances. 
It will NOT remove the data by default; but it will make old info invisible for the users.

The idea is to implement better software management:
* the software name could be something generic ("MS Office") or a bit more specific ("MS Office 2019")
* more detailed version info could be set on the software instance
* licenses could be linked to users, devices and/or software instance
  * this covers downgrade rights, as you can now link for example a "Windows Server 2019 Standard" license to both "Windows Server 2019 Standard" and "Windows Server 2016 Standard"
  * this covers usage rights, such as "Windows Server User CAL"
