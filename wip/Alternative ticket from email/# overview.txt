Work in progress. The idea is to either extend and contribute back to iTop, or to fork the 3.0.5 version of the Combodo Create-Ticket-From-Email extension.

- combine 'combodo-email-synchro' and 'itop-standard-email'?
- should differentiate between error (inform specific contact/mail) and policy violations (should bounce mail back to sender with a case specific notification)
- should add 'Incoming eMail Policies'

Notifications: 
- independent from PreCanned Reply. 
- If we want to include the original email: independent from Notifications (ActionEmail)

Errors: 
- failed to decode 
- failed to create new contact for unknown caller

(possible) Policy violations:
- attachment too big (should this stay a general setting in the config file, or become a mailbox based one?)
- answering to closed tickets
- unknown caller
- unknown ticket (nothing to update. Either ticket never existed or it got deleted -> let user create new one anyway)
- multiple recipients (forbid To:, BCC:)
- undesired pattern (out of office, read:, delivered:)


Since there's plenty of policy violations with custom behavior (delete or mark as error; return to sender or not; custom notification), 
it could be handy to share this policy amongst mailboxes.
